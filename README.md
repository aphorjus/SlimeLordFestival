# Slime Lord Festival

The following is a README template for the Slime Lord Festival java game.

## Getting Started

Our game was developed using IntelliJ IDE.

### How to play this game

#### OVERWORLD: 

Start off by hosting a game with 2-4 players, or joining someone else's game. Upon entering the game, each player will start off at each 
4 corners of the Overworld map. Player 1 (Blue Slimelord) will start off by moving their slime 15 tiles in any direction on the path. The 
highlighted path provides a 15 tiled path for the player, in which they can click to move to any of the highlighted tiles. After player 1 
makes all his/her moves, it's player 2's turn (Green Slimelord), and so on. Every player can conquer a Token Tent, which generates 100 
tokens per turn for that player, and can also be conquered by another player.
